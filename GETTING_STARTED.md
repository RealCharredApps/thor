## 🎯 Next Steps to Get Started

### 1. **Set Up Dependencies**
```bash
cd /Users/bbm2/Documents/GitHub/thor
python3 scripts/setup.py
```

### 2. **Get Your Anthropic API Key**
- Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
- Create an API key
- Set it in your environment:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. **Quick Start with New Project**
```bash
./scripts/quickstart.sh my-awesome-project
```

### 4. **Or Setup for Existing Project**
```bash
./thor setup /path/to/your/existing/project
./thor chat /path/to/your/existing/project
```

## 🤖 Expert Agents

THOR includes 5 specialized AI agents:

1. **thor_architect** - Master architect for complex software projects
2. **code_wizard** - Expert programmer for implementation and code quality  
3. **devops_master** - DevOps expert for infrastructure and deployment
4. **security_guardian** - Security expert for application protection
5. **ai_specialist** - AI/ML expert for intelligent application features

## 💡 Example Usage

### Interactive Development
```bash
./thor chat /path/to/project
```

Then ask things like:
- "Create a complete FastAPI application with JWT authentication"
